# Weather Forecast - Python Project

This is a  Python project that fetches current weather data and a 5-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
The app also supports checking the weather for multiple cities at once.

Features

- Get current weather (temperature, humidity, wind, condition)
- View 5-day forecast (daily weather summary)
- Support for multiple cities (e.g., "Lagos, Abuja, London")
- Gracefully handles invalid city names or API errors
- Includes unit tests using ‘pytest’ and ‘monkeypatch’ for mocking API responses

Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- ‘requests’
- ‘pytest’ (for testing)

Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Future Improvements
Here are a few ideas for future updates:

- Add support for saving search history to a file or database

- Allow users to select temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit)

- Integrate geolocation to auto-detect user’s city

- Add alerts for extreme weather conditions
